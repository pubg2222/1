    "This code is an implementation of a simple chatbot using the NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) library in Python. Let's go through the code step by step to understand its functionality:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Importing the necessary modules:\n",
    "   - `nltk`: The main module of the NLTK library.\n",
    "   - `Chat` and `reflections` from `nltk.chat.util`: These are utility classes that provide a framework for creating chatbots and handling pattern matching.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Defining reflections:\n",
    "   - `reflections` is a dictionary that maps personal pronouns and verb forms to their corresponding reflections. It is used to transform user inputs to simulate more natural conversations. For example, if the user says \"I am happy,\" the chatbot will transform it to \"You are happy\" before generating a response.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Defining conversation patterns and responses:\n",
    "   - `pairs` is a list of conversation patterns and their corresponding responses.\n",
    "   - Each pattern is a regular expression (regex) string that the user input is matched against.\n",
    "   - The responses are a list of possible responses that the chatbot can give based on the matched pattern.\n",
    "   - The patterns and responses are defined as pairs within the `pairs` list.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Defining the `chat()` function:\n",
    "   - This function prints a greeting message and creates an instance of the `Chat` class.\n",
    "   - The `Chat` class is initialized with the `pairs` list and the `reflections` dictionary.\n",
    "   - It then starts the conversation loop, where the chatbot waits for user input and generates responses based on the matched pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Initiating the conversation:\n",
    "   - The `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` block checks if the script is being run directly.\n",
    "   - If it is, the `chat()` function is called to initiate the conversation with the chatbot.\n",
    "\n",
    "The chatbot responds to various user inputs and patterns such as greetings, asking for the bot's name, asking about the weather, talking about sports, movies, etc. The chatbot uses pattern matching to identify user intents and generates appropriate responses based on the predefined patterns and responses in the `pairs` list.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please note that the code assumes you have the NLTK library installed and have downloaded any required datasets or resources. If not, you may need to install NLTK and download the required resources using NLTK's `nltk.download()` function before running the code successfully.\n",
