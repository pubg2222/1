""" 
The code begins by importing two modules: datetime and random. The datetime module provides classes for working with dates and times, while the random module allows generating random numbers and making random selections.

Next, the code defines several dictionaries that store the necessary data for generating a flight schedule:

routes stores the flight routes as keys and their respective distances as values.
aircraft stores the aircraft types as keys and their respective capacities as values.
crew stores the crew types as keys and their availability schedule as values.
airport_congestion stores the congestion times for each airport.
weather stores the weather conditions for each airport on different days of the week.
The generate_flight_schedule() function is defined. This function is responsible for generating a random flight schedule based on the available data.

Inside the generate_flight_schedule() function, the code begins by randomly selecting a route from the routes dictionary using the random.choice() function. The distance of the chosen route is retrieved.

Next, a random aircraft type is selected from the aircraft dictionary using random.choice(). The capacity of the chosen aircraft type is obtained.

The departure airport is extracted from the chosen route by splitting the route string using '-' as the delimiter. The congestion times for the departure airport are retrieved from the airport_congestion dictionary.

A list of available departure times is created by iterating from 7 to 20 (7 AM to 8 PM) and excluding the congested times. If a time is present in the congestion list, it is not added to the options. A random departure time is then chosen from the available options using random.choice().

A crew type is selected based on the availability for the current day. This is done by first retrieving the current day using datetime.date.today().strftime('%a'). Then, a list of crew types is created based on the availability schedule in the crew dictionary. The chosen crew type is randomly selected from the available options using random.choice().

The weather conditions at the departure airport are obtained from the weather dictionary using the chosen departure airport and the current day.

The estimated arrival time is calculated by dividing the distance of the route by an assumed average speed of 500 miles per hour. The arrival time is obtained by adding the departure time and the travel time.

The weather conditions at the arrival airport are obtained from the weather dictionary using the arrival airport and the current day.

Finally, the flight schedule is printed, displaying various details such as the chosen route, distance, aircraft type, capacity, departure airport, departure time, selected crew type, weather conditions at the departure airport, estimated arrival time, and weather conditions at the arrival airport.

The generate_flight_schedule() function is called at the end to generate and print a random flight schedule.

In summary, the code simulates the process of generating a random flight schedule based on predefined data. It selects a random route, aircraft type, departure time, and crew type. It also considers the weather conditions at the departure and arrival airports. The resulting flight schedule is then printed.
